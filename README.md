Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at my side projects!
This is a portfolio website that I made over the summer between 7th-8th grade
to aid in high school admissions. It contains my technology projects, work experience,
extra-curriculars, and few other things. The website itself was also intended to be
a showcase of my coding skills at the time.
